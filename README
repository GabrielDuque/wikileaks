    andrew@typeslashcode.com
    v0.0.0.0.0.2
    
    Prerequisites:
      HTTrack (http://www.httrack.com/httrack-3.43-9C.tar.gz)
        *to update mirror of cablegate site
      MongoDB (www.mongodb.org)
        *database to store parsed cables
        *ouputs json dump
    
    Functionality:
      Will update Cablegate Web Mirror, and pull all existing cables into a 
        MongoDB Collection where their 'Reference ID' is their '_id', and they
        contain the following properties:
          'reference_id','date_time','classification','origin','header','body'
    
    Usage:
      Make sure that mongod is running. The software is configured to access
        Mongod at it's default location, so change that if necessary.
      Confirm that httrack and mongoexport are accesable in your PATH.
      run 'python process.py'
      after that
      run 'mongoexport -d wikileaks -c cables -o dump/cables.json'
      
    Notes:
      The Tornado app that is there right now serves no function. To come..?
